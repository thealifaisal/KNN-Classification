Limitations
Chi-Square is sensitive to small frequencies in cells of tables. 
Generally, when the expected value in a cell of a table is less than 5, chi-square can lead to errors in conclusions.

When to use Chi-Squared Test:
When the data type of our feature to be tested and the target variable are both categorical 
(i.e. we have a classification problem) we can use Chi-Squared test.

Chi-Squared Test Explained:
The Pearson’s Chi-Squared test, or just Chi-Squared test, is named after the mathematician Karl Pearson. 
It is also called a “goodness of fit” statistic.
